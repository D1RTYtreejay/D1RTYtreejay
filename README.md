- 👋 Hi, I’m @D1RTYtreejay
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity both Red Teaming and Blue Teaming. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SC200 for Blue Teaming and Pentesting tools for Red Teaming. 
- 💞️ Mentorship opportunities are always welcome, I’m looking to collaborate with white hat hackers on Pentesting techniques.
